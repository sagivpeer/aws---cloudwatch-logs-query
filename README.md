# aws---cloudwatch-logs-query

My jorney to the AWS API world:
at first, I have accessed amazon cloud trail to create a new trail.
After reading a little bit in forums and amazons documentation, I realized that it's easier to access cloudwatch via the API.
After searching in more forums, I found something that is called "boto3",
It's the python's library to access AWS's API.
Later on, I needed to set up the region, the log group, and the log stream group to query the API.
afterward, i have received a dict object which I have changed to JSON to view the logs better
